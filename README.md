This project was made with ReactJS.

## Components


### Search Bar

The search bar container has an input and a button. After completing the imput with a username and pressing the button the handleSearch arrow
function handles the fetching of the list of Gists for that user. The list is passed to App through addItem function.

### Cards

Gets the list of gists from App and makes a "card" for each item in the list using .map
### Modal

Opens when clicking a card and displays the content of the file. 

### App

The main function which contains all the components.


### Future improvements

I didn't manage to implement the  Filetypes task so in the future I would find a solution to do it.

I would style my page better. Add some images or combine the colors better. I am not really good at designing and combining colors, but I would like to learn and improve this part.
